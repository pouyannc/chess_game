# chess_game

Command line two player chess game. 

You play by entering the coordinate of the piece space, then entering the position you want to move the piece to. The program will not allow any invalid moves according to the rules of chess. It will also not allow you to pick a piece with no valid moves, i.e. if the piece is blocked from moving or if it will put/keep your king in check. Save and quit the game by typing 'save' when it is time to pick a piece. You can resume from the last save at the start screen, or start a new game.
